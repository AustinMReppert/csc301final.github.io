# Details
Google has been looking to phase out third party cookies for a while. Unlike some of its competitors Google has a multi-billion-dollar stake in the changes it makes to cookies and ultimately advertising. Chrome is looking to phase out 3rd party cookies by early 2022. The first technology called FLoC or Federated Learning of Cohorts attempts to solve two advertising requirements. That is that the ad is being served on a website that is relevant to the add and that the user has general interests related to the ad. FLoC relies on machine learning algorithms analyzing the user’s browser history to categorize them into groups. These categorizations called cohorts composed of at least thousands of people. The machine learning is performed on the device, so only cohorts leave the device. The other technology called TURTLEDOVE allows advertisers to target users based off previous specific actions like abandoning a shopping cart. 

# Opinion
I believe that just like cookies, there will be companies/websites that exploit these technologies in ways that they were not intended to be used. I think that these technologies are better than third party cookies and are a good middle ground. These technologies also seem more transparent and easier to avoid for privacy minded individuals. The Hacker News pointed out the largest problem will likely be grouping users. The industry will need to be carful which labels are too specific and avoid labels that involve things such as religion, race, etc. My only other concern is how this will affect power usage on mobile devices. Maybe more processors will be built will ai acceleration in mind. I don’t see how anything could be worse than third party cookies, which pretty much give any user a unique id.
