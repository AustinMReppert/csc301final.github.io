# Details and Opinions
The pandemic has forced nearly everything online. Zoom calls are simply something we must live with for the time being. Going virtual may not be ideal but it also has its benefits. Events and conferences were typically expensive for companies but allow employees to stay on the leading edge of their field. Going virtual means lowering costs because there is no travel expenses and the time lost due to conference is shorter. In a field like Cybersecurity, information is a key role in the war against cyber criminals. Academic articles, whitepapers, and blogs are certainly a decent way to keep up with cybersecurity trends. Still conferences serve as a place for companies and ideas to show the fruits of their labor in a more personal way. They also serve as a way to network with colleagues within your field and sometimes even offer students opportunities to break into the industry. The Daily Swig has compiled a list of information about all upcoming cybersecurity conferences for 2021. Many are fully virtual, but some are seeking a hybrid approach. There is not much more to the story, but seeing people trying to continue normal life however they can is refreshing. Many of the conferences look like fun and I certainly plan on trying to attend a few to further my skills.
