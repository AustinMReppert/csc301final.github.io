# Details
Apple is giving users tools to strengthen their privacy. A change allowing users to opt out of tracking using Apple’s “Identifier for Advertisers” has companies like Google and Facebook shaking in their boots.  These changes have caused Google IOS app updates to grind to a halt. For the user, these are welcoming changes. However, such changes will have a significant impact on the business model of big data companies. Facebook estimates that only 30% of people will opt into targeted tracking. Facebook is testing notifications to warn users about the privacy popups they are about to get. Doing do does not violet Apple’s TOS. It is unlikely that Apple’s intentions are truly genuine because they are in the process of starting their own ad network. The kick in the shins to other companies is that Apple’s own apps seem to be immune to such stringent privacy controls.  

# Opinion
Apple’s privacy changes are a step in the right direction. Users should always be given a choice to forfeit their data. It is somewhat concerning that Apple is starting an ad network given their position makes it akin to insider trading. However, 3rd party companies have made few efforts to further privacy controls. The device permissions should be the gatekeeper to a user’s data. Strict changes are the only way to drive user privacy forward even if it means making a splash in billion-dollar industries. If Apple is the only one who can do it, then we must make temporary concessions.

The crux of this situation is that apps only exist because they produce valuable data. When companies cannot secure the data in a reliable fashion, naturally they will push back.  It is evil and it is what they need to do to survive. This highlights the biggest problem about digital platforms. People are hesitant to pay for services. If companies made users pay for a service, there would be no need for ads. Paying Google a small fee for their services is how things should be. Consumers should not expect anything for free. Paying for services is paying for privacy. As a developer you pay for API usage. It should be the same for users. Perhaps this could even curb the rampant number of bots on the internet.
