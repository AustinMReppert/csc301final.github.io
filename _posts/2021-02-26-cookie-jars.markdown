# Details
Cookies have always been the easiest method for companies to track users across the internet. Many experts and companies agree that cookies are too powerful simple advertising data. Some browsers and companies like Apple are seeking to increase the user’s privacy by limiting cookies. These new anti-tracking measures are throwing many companies into a frenzy to find new methods or loopholes to track users. One such loophole is called CNAME Cloaking. By adding CNAME records to a subdomain many browsers can be tricked into sharing cookies that are not really from the same site. The hacker news reports that this method has increased by 21% of the past 22 months. Firefox rolled out a feature called total cookie protection to deal with the new tracking method, while chrome is lagging behind. Firefox describes total cookie protection as basically having a cookie jar for each website. Cookies are only shared between jars in rare circumstances like when using the “Sign in with “features of sites like Google.  Apple and Brave have also added features to prevent CNAME Cloaking.

# Opinions
I think cookies can be used in hideously evil tracking schemes. The attempts to limit their power by browsers, specifically Firefox are welcome changes.  I personally have been using Firefox’s strictest tracking protection as well as what U-Block Origin adds without any problem for a few years now. I very rarely experience any hiccups related to cookies. It is interesting to see what tracking methods companies will try. Fingerprinting is likely what many companies will result to if cookies are rendered powerless.
