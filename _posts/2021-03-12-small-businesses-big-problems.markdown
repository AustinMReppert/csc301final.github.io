# Details/Opinions
ZDNet reports the Australian government provided 14 pages of advice to help businesses avoid cybercrime attacks. The document emphasized awareness, especially against ransomware attacks. This is highlighted because approximately 93% of Australia’s workforce is employed by small businesses. I thought this was quite strange given how corporations are increasing in power nearly everywhere else. It also makes defending against cyber crime more challenging because cybersecurity workers are too expensive for most small businesses. The paper also noted that cyber  insurance should be a part of their strategy. I think that calling on non-technical users to exert cyber diligence is a fool’s dream. Cyber attacks are hard for even professionals to mitigate when applying industry standards. I think these small companies should rely on larger corporations like Microsoft where they can. Predeveloped tools are often good enough for small businesses and are easier to setup and secure. Perhaps the government could even subsidize deals with consultants or companies so that small businesses can adopt a secure software stack that fits their needs. The risk of such attacks is estimated to be around 1 billion dollars. I do not think the government could do anything that would increase the security of businesses besides subsidies. It is good to see any effort to improve a businesses security, I just think it is infeasible.
