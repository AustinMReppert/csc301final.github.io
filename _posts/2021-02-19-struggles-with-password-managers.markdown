# Details
Getting users to use good passwords is extremely difficult. If a user forgets their password it can causes losses for them and if employees lose passwords valuable time is lost. The definition of good also varies greatly from one user to another. The reality is most people have terrible passwords. Furthermore, most of these passwords are re-used from site to site. Getting users to use a password manager is the easiest way to improve security. There are quite a few options from browser password managers, Googleâ€™s password manager, Unix Pass, or a dedicated password manager. Using a dedicated password manager is the most seamless way to do so and is why so many people choose LastPass. Up until now LastPass was a go to for many security minded people, but changes to their free plan might force them to pay up or switch to another service like Bitwarden. ZDNET reports that LastPass is forcing free users to pick between mobile devices or desktops/laptops. Or they can also upgrade to a paid plan.  

# Opinion
Getting users to be secure is really a challenge for society. Companies giving users free service is of course not mandatory, nor should it ever be. Still this move seems too shortsighted. Many password management companies offer free services but can still get buy. Running a password management system is not extremely complicated and likely does not cost much. Through corporate plans and other paid users, they should be able to eat the cost. One would think that having customers that may upgrade when they can afford it would be preferable than not having them at all. Perhaps LastPass suspects that people are abusing its free plan. Switching from one password manager to another is usually quire easy if you export your data to a csv file so many are likely to switch to other services.
